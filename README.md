# CS221 Data Structures and Algorithms ðŸš€

Welcome to my CS221 Data Structures and Algorithms repository! Here, you'll embark on a journey through the fascinating world of data structures and algorithms. This repository is not just a collection of code; it's a documentation of my learning process, complete with explanations, visualizations, and practical examples.

## Introduction

Hey there! I'm Ahmed Musharaf, and I invite you to join me on this educational adventure through the CS221 Data Structures and Algorithms course. As I delve into the intricacies of algorithms and the elegance of data structures, I'm documenting my progress here to share knowledge, foster understanding, and inspire collaborative learning.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Clear Explanations**: Each data structure and algorithm is accompanied by in-depth explanations and visualizations, making complex concepts more accessible.

- **Sample Problems**: Reinforce your understanding by tackling a curated set of sample problems. Practice is key, and this repository is designed to help you apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.

- **Language Agnostic**: Whether you're comfortable with Python, Java, C++, or another language, you'll find implementations easy to understand. The goal is to cater to a diverse audience with varied language preferences.

- **Contributions Welcome**: Learning is a collaborative effort. I wholeheartedly welcome contributions! If you have a new algorithm or data structure to introduce, an enhancement for an existing one, or a valuable suggestion, please follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
